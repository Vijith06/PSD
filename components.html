  <h1>Components of a Computer in the CPU</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="component-name">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</span>
      <p class="component-description">The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It is made up of the ALU, CU, and Registers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="component-name">Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</span>
      <p class="component-description">The ALU performs mathematical operations, such as addition and subtraction, and logical operations, such as AND and OR.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="component-name">Control Unit (CU)</span>
      <p class="component-description">The CU manages the operations of the CPU, including fetching instructions, decoding them, and coordinating the activity of the ALU and Registers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="component-name">Registers</span>
      <p class="component-description">Registers are small, high-speed storage units within the CPU. They hold data that is being processed or data that is waiting to be processed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="component-name">Cache Memory</span>
      <p class="component-description">Cache Memory is a small, fast memory system within the CPU that stores frequently accessed data for quick access. This helps to speed up the processing of instructions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
