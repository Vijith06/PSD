<h1><center>Mainframe computer</center></h1>
<p>A mainframe computer is a large computer capable of rapidly processing massive amounts of data at high speeds. Mainframe computers by definition are computers that have a lot of memory and processors, so they can do billions of transactions and simple calculations in real time. A mainframe is used for transaction servers, commercial databases, and applications that need ample reliability, security, and speed.

By definition, a mainframe will process enormous volumes of data at a quick rate. Large-scale operations such as censuses, industry and consumer data, ERP, and other similar tools are essential for a wide range of different types of work. Major businesses rely on mainframe computers for key applications like bulk data and transaction processing.
<br>The first mainframe computer was invented in the 1930s by Harvard scholar Howard Aiken, who popularized the name mainframe. His idea was to build a massive calculator for the solution of a set of nonlinear equations. However, it wasn't until 1943 that the machine was ready for operation. It cost roughly $200,000 to create, weighed five tons, and took up a whole room. From the late 1950s through the early 1970s, a small number of manufacturers produced centralized server PCs. They were known as "IBM and the Seven Dwarfs," a group of manufacturers that included IBM as well as Honeywell, GE, NCR, Burroughs, Control Data, UNIVAC and RCA.

Mainframe computers are still physically large. In the 1940s, a mainframe was about the size of a one-car garage. However, over the course of the 1950s, mainframe computers decreased in size. A standard example of a mainframe computer would be roughly the height and width of a 6-foot-high closet. Mainframes have remained about this size. With current technology, it would be impossible to fit all of a mainframe's processing and memory into a substantially smaller desktop case.
<br>What is a mainframe system? Essentially, a mainframe system is the core data repository, or hub, in a corporation's data processing centre, and it is connected to users through less capable devices such as workstations, terminals, and other similar devices. Mainframe operating systems are advanced technologies with a wide range of characteristics and objectives that differ significantly from one another. They are operating systems —a group of programs that manage the inner workings of a computer system, such as the storage devices and operating system of the memory, processors and peripherals— specifically for mainframe computers. Z is a super-stable operating system for mainframe computers that are used for essential applications. IBM introduced this operating system in 2000. It assures the security and maintenance of the computer. The architecture of Z is based on a 64-bit design. Mainframe computers still run the Z operating system. Compatibility and dependability are two of the mainframe computer's characteristics. Proper forethought and execution are needed to bring these features to life.
