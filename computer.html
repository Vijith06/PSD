	  <h3>Computer</h3>
	  <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Computer skills</h3>
	  <p>Computer skills are abilities and knowledge which allow you to use computers and related technology. They let you use word processing software, access the Internet, manage files, or create presentations. Advanced computer skills would let you access databases, use spreadsheets, and even code.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Types of computer</h3>
	  <p>There are four types in the classifications of the computer by size:
	  </p>
	  <ol type="i">
	      <li><a href="supercomputer.html">Supercomputer</a></li>
          <li><a href="mainframecomputer.html">Mainframe computer</a></li>
          <li><a href="minicomputer.html">Minicomputer</a></li>
		  <li><a href="microcomputer.html">Micro Computer</a></li>

		    <h4><center>Hardware</center></h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Motherboard. This is a printed circuit board that holds the central processing unit (CPU) and other essential internal hardware and functions as the central hub that all other hardware components run through.</li>
			  <li>CPU. The CPU is the brain of the computer that processes and executes digital instructions from various programs; its clock speed determines the computer's performance and efficiency in processing data.</li>
			  <li>RAM. RAM -- or dynamic RAM -- is temporary memory storage that makes information immediately accessible to programs; RAM is volatile memory, so stored data is cleared when the computer powers off.</li>
			  <li>Hard drive. Hard disk drives are physical storage devices that store both permanent and temporary data in different formats, including programs, OSes, device files, photos, etc.</li>
			  <li>Solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs are solid-state storage devices based on NAND flash memory technology; SSDs are non-volatile, so they can safely store data even when the computer is powered down.</li>
			  <li>Optical drive. Optical drives typically reside in an on-device drive bay; they enable the computer to read and interact with nonmagnetic external media, such as compact disc read-only memory or digital video discs,/li>
			  <li>Graphics processing unit. This chip-based device processes graphical data and often functions as an extension to the main CPU.</li>
			  <li>Network interface card (NIC). A NIC is a circuit board or chip that enables the computer to connect to a network; also known as a network adapter or local area network adapter, it typically supports connection to an Ethernet network.</li>

	    <div class="col-md-6">
		     <h4><center>software</center></h4>
		    <ul>
			   <li>System software is a computer program that helps the user to run computer hardware or software and manages the interaction between them. Essentially, it is software that constantly runs in the computer background, maintaining the computer hardware and computer's basic functionalities, including the operating system, utility software, and interface</li>
			   <li>The operating system is the most prominent example of system software that acts as an interface between the user and system hardware. It is a group of software that handles the execution of programs and offers general services for the application that runs over the computer.</li>.
			   <li>In computing, the device driver is a type of software that operates or controls some specific hardware devices linked to your system</li>.
			   <li>In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of permanent software embedded in the system's ROM (read-only memory) to provide low-level control for some particular system device hardware. </li>
			   <li>Utility software is developed to provide support in analyzing, optimizing, along configuring and maintaining a computer.</li>
			   <li>Application programs or software applications are end-user computer programs developed primarily to provide specific functionality to the user. The applications programs assist the user in accomplishing numerous tasks such as doing online research, completing notes, designing graphics, managing the finances, watching a movie, writing documents, playing games, and many more</li>
